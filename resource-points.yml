# Advanced settings to detect custom items worth.
# name: The full name of the item with colors.
# lore: The full line of the item with colors.
#       Notice that using plain text for this option compares it to each *line* not the whole lore.
# These two options above must be an exact match, otherwise you can use
# the special keyword "CONTAINS:" or "REGEX:" at the beginning.
# CONTAINS: Checks if the given text is present in the field and it is case-sensitive.
# REGEX: Regular Expression
# E.g. The following accepts items with names "legendary sword" and "Lvl.3 legendary axe",
# but not "Legendary sword" or "legend axe"
# item:
#   name: "CONTAINS:legendary"

# material: The full name of the item's material.
# custom-model: The 1.14 custom model data of the item.

# enchants: A list of enchantments that the item should have.
# Additional enchantments on the item that are not in this list are ignored.

# nbt: This checks if the item has some kind of NBT data with the specified value.
# You shouldn't bother with this option if you don't know what NBT datas your custom item plugins use.
# Most of them don't use them at all.
# This also has performance penalties, so use them sparingly.
